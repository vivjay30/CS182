    "The page includes questions requiring implementation of some of the search algorithms we studied in class. Make sure to download the pacman project zip file from the above link. Do not use Assignment 1’s zip file because there are some small changes. You can, however, use your search.py and searchAgents.py files if they are helpful.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Question 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to design a ghost agent to play with people, how would you go about choosing a strategy for the ghost? Think about the strategies people might use when playing this game, and how they might differ from strategies played by computer agents.\n",
